# Nearside iOS Code Screen - Starter

Welcome to Nearside's Code Screen starter repository!

## Quickstart

You'll need the following:

1. Xcode 12+

The Xcode project has both a SwiftUI and UIKit target – feel free to use whichever you're most comfortable with. There's also a Swift Playground that we'll use for the first coding exercise.

Feel free to use any first-party libraries and language features in your implementation (e.g. Combine, closures, async/await). Although probably not necessary, third-party libraries are also allowed.

## What problem will I be solving?
There will be two parts to the problem:
1. a non-iOS-specific coding exercise (~20 min)
2. wrapping that coding exercise in a little iOS app (~20 min)

We'll save ~5 min at the beginning + end for hellos, howdy-do's, and questions.

The Mobile@Nearside promise: we won't ask you to solve any problems that you learned in Data Structures & Algorithms class.

The task at hand will be a straightforward programming problem for which there is an iterative solution that can be obtained in less than 30 lines of code.

Other than that, you'll have to wait and see! 😁

(If you actually have additional questions, please reach out to your Nearside recruiter or hiring manager -- we'd love to help!)

## Instructions
Make sure you have this repo downloaded and set up with Xcode _before you join the call_. It would also be a good idea to run the app on a simulator to make sure you have a simulator ready to go.

If you don't, we'll happily wait with you while the simulator loads, but that will cut into your programming time! 😱 👩🏽‍💻 ⏳
